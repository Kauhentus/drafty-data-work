"a second comment is that you have a nice ability to “train” your tool. 
because there’s already a lot of good data in drafty, so you can think of input as 
“given this data that is probably correct, what other data that is not there is likely to be correct”? 
so then the problem becomes completing the set of data from some starter data, than looking for a specific professor"

1) have professor name, the data is incorrect
2) have professor name, the data is missing (i.e. no join year)
3) do not have professor name (i.e. new hire)

- is it for data validation? data discovery?
- finding error in data is difficult, manually checking every professor not good
